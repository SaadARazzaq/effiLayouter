## Raw Files Directory

This folder `(raw_files/)` contains old, uncompiled, or intermediate versions of the project’s source files that were created during the development phase.

## Purpose

The files in this folder serve as reference material from earlier stages of development. They include scripts, components, and modules that were used for testing, prototyping, or feature implementation before the final version of the frontend and backend was compiled and merged.

## Folder Contents

- Legacy versions of frontend and backend code files
- Experimental or temporary scripts
- Step-by-step implementations developed during feature testing
- Backup copies of files before refactoring or integration


## ⚠️ Note

1. These files are not part of the active codebase and should not be modified or executed directly.
2. They are retained for documentation and reference purposes only.
3. The compiled and production-ready code can be found in the main project directories (e.g., /frontend and /backend).


## ✅ Usage Guidelines

Refer to these files only if you need to trace implementation history or recover an old logic.
